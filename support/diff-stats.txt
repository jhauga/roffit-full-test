<p><strong>Total Files Tested</strong>  - 705</p>
<p><strong>Tested Files with Differences</strong> - 8</p>

<p>The files built account for files tested (x1) for source and pull (x2) for options (xUsed).</p>
<p><small>built = (optonCount x filesTested) * 2 (<em>source and pull repo)</em> ---
So--- optonCount = 2 ; filesTested= 705;  repos = 2;</small></p>
