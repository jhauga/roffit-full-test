<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Description</h2>
<p class="level0">Pass a pointer to a linked list of strings with &quot;connect to&quot; information to use for establishing network connections with this handle. The linked list should be a fully valid list of <span Class="bold">struct curl_slist</span> structs properly filled in. Use <span Class="emphasis">curl_slist_append(3)</span> to create the list and <span Class="emphasis">curl_slist_free_all(3)</span> to clean up an entire list. </p>
<p class="level0">Each single string should be written using the format HOST:PORT:CONNECT-TO-HOST:CONNECT-TO-PORT where HOST is the host of the request, PORT is the port of the request, CONNECT-TO-HOST is the host name to connect to, and CONNECT-TO-PORT is the port to connect to. </p>
<p class="level0">The first string that matches the request&#39;s host and port is used. </p>
<p class="level0">Dotted numerical IP addresses are supported for HOST and CONNECT-TO-HOST. A numerical IPv6 address must be written within [brackets]. </p>
<p class="level0">Any of the four values may be empty. When the HOST or PORT is empty, the host or port will always match (the request&#39;s host or port is ignored). When CONNECT-TO-HOST or CONNECT-TO-PORT is empty, the &quot;connect to&quot; feature will be disabled for the host or port, and the request&#39;s host or port will be used to establish the network connection. </p>
<p class="level0">This option is suitable to direct the request at a specific server, e.g. at a specific cluster node in a cluster of servers. </p>
<p class="level0">The &quot;connect to&quot; host and port are only used to establish the network connection. They do NOT affect the host and port that are used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI, certificate verification) or for the application protocols. </p>
<p class="level0">In contrast to <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_RESOLVE(3)</span>, the option <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_CONNECT_TO(3)</span> does not pre-populate the DNS cache and therefore it does not affect future transfers of other easy handles that have been added to the same multi handle. </p>
<p class="level0">The &quot;connect to&quot; host and port are ignored if they are equal to the host and the port in the request URL, because connecting to the host and the port in the request URL is the default behavior. </p>
<p class="level0">If an HTTP proxy is used for a request having a special &quot;connect to&quot; host or port, and the &quot;connect to&quot; host or port differs from the request&#39;s host and port, the HTTP proxy is automatically switched to tunnel mode for this specific request. This is necessary because it is not possible to connect to a specific host or port in normal (non-tunnel) mode. </p>
<p class="level0">When this option is passed to <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_setopt(3)</span>, libcurl will not copy the entire list so you <span Class="bold">must</span> keep it around until you no longer use this <span Class="emphasis">handle</span> for a transfer before you call <span Class="emphasis">curl_slist_free_all(3)</span> on the list. </p><a name="DEFAULT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Default</h2>
