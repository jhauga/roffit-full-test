&#35;include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;
&nbsp;
CURLMcode curl_multi_perform(CURLM *multi_handle, int *running_handles);

<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Description</h2>
<p class="level0">This function performs transfers on all the added handles that need attention in a non-blocking fashion. The easy handles have previously been added to the multi handle with <span Class="emphasis">curl_multi_add_handle(3)</span>. </p>
<p class="level0">When an application has found out there&#39;s data available for the multi_handle or a timeout has elapsed, the application should call this function to read/write whatever there is to read or write right now etc. <span Class="emphasis">curl_multi_perform(3)</span> returns as soon as the reads/writes are done. This function does not require that there actually is any data available for reading or that data can be written, it can be called just in case. It will store the number of handles that still transfer data in the second argument&#39;s integer-pointer. </p>
<p class="level0">If the amount of <span Class="emphasis">running_handles</span> is changed from the previous call (or is less than the amount of easy handles you have added to the multi handle), you know that there is one or more transfers less &quot;running&quot;. You can then call <span Class="emphasis">curl_multi_info_read(3)</span> to get information about each individual completed transfer, and that returned info includes CURLcode and more. If an added handle fails quickly, it may never be counted as a running_handle. You could use <span Class="emphasis">curl_multi_info_read(3)</span> to track actual status of the added handles in that case. </p>
<p class="level0">When <span Class="emphasis">running_handles</span> is set to zero (0) on the return of this function, there is no longer any transfers in progress. </p>
<p class="level0">When this function returns error, the state of all transfers are uncertain and they cannot be continued. <span Class="emphasis">curl_multi_perform(3)</span> should not be called again on the same multi handle after an error has been returned, unless first removing all the handles and adding new ones. </p><a name="EXAMPLE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Example</h2><pre class="level0">
int still_running;

<p class="level0">CURLMcode type, general libcurl multi interface error code. </p>
<p class="level0">This function returns errors regarding the whole multi stack. Problems on individual transfers may have occurred even when this function returns <span Class="emphasis">CURLM_OK</span>. Use <span Class="emphasis">curl_multi_info_read(3)</span> to figure out how individual transfers did. </p><a name="TYPICAL"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Typical usage</h2>
<p class="level0">Most applications will use <span Class="emphasis">curl_multi_poll(3)</span> to make libcurl wait for activity on any of the ongoing transfers. As soon as one or more file descriptor has activity or the function times out, the application calls <span Class="emphasis">curl_multi_perform(3)</span>. </p><a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">See also</h2>
