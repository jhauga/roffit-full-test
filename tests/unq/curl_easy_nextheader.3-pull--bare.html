<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Description</h2>
<p class="level0">This function lets an application iterate over all previously received HTTP headers. </p>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">origin</span> argument is for specifying which headers to receive, as a single HTTP transfer might provide headers from several different places and they may then have different importance to the user and headers using the same name might be used. The <span Class="emphasis">origin</span> is a bitmask for what header sources you want. See the <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_header(3)</span> man page for the origin descriptions. </p>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">request</span> argument tells libcurl from which request you want headers from. A single transfer might consist of a series of HTTP requests and this argument lets you specify which particular individual request you want the headers from. 0 being the first request and then the number increases for further redirects or when multi-state authentication is used. Passing in -1 is a shortcut to &quot;the last&quot; request in the series, independently of the actual amount of requests used. </p>
<p class="level0">It is suggested that you pass in the same <span Class="bold">origin</span> and <span Class="bold">request</span> when iterating over a range of headers as changing the value mid-loop might give you unexpected results. </p>
<p class="level0">If <span Class="emphasis">prev</span> is NULL, this function returns a pointer to the first header stored within the given scope (origin + request). </p>
<p class="level0">If <span Class="emphasis">prev</span> is a pointer to a previously returned header struct, <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_nextheader(3)</span> returns a pointer the next header stored within the given scope. This way, an application can iterate over all available headers. </p>
<p class="level0">The memory for the struct this points to, is owned and managed by libcurl and is associated with the easy handle. Applications must copy the data if they want it to survive subsequent API calls or the life-time of the easy handle. </p><a name="EXAMPLE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Example</h2><pre class="level0">
