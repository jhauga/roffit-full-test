<p class="level0">libcurl-easy - easy interface overview </p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Description</h2>
<p class="level0">When using libcurl&#39;s &quot;easy&quot; interface you init your session and get a handle (often referred to as an &quot;easy handle&quot;), which you use as input to the easy interface functions you use. Use <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_init(3)</span> to get the handle. </p>
<p class="level0">You continue by setting all the options you want in the upcoming transfer, the most important among them is the URL itself (you cannot transfer anything without a specified URL as you may have figured out yourself). You might want to set some callbacks as well that will be called from the library when data is available etc. <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_setopt(3)</span> is used for all this. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_URL(3)</span> is the only option you really must set, as otherwise there can be no transfer. Another commonly used option is <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_VERBOSE(3)</span> that will help you see what libcurl is doing under the hood, which is useful when debugging for example. The <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_setopt(3)</span> man page has a full index of the almost 300 available options. </p>
<p class="level0">If you at any point would like to blank all previously set options for a single easy handle, you can call <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_reset(3)</span> and you can also make a clone of an easy handle (with all its set options) using <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_duphandle(3)</span>. </p>
<p class="level0">When all is setup, you tell libcurl to perform the transfer using <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_perform(3)</span>.  It will then do the entire operation and will not return until it is done (successfully or not). </p>
<p class="level0">After the transfer has been made, you can set new options and make another transfer, or if you are done, cleanup the session by calling <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_cleanup(3)</span>. If you want persistent connections, you do not cleanup immediately, but instead run ahead and perform other transfers using the same easy handle. </p><a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">See also</h2>
