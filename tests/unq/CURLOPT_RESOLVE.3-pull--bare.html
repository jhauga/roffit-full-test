<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Description</h2>
<p class="level0">Pass a pointer to a linked list of strings with host name resolve information to use for requests with this handle. The linked list should be a fully valid list of <span Class="bold">struct curl_slist</span> structs properly filled in. Use <span Class="emphasis">curl_slist_append(3)</span> to create the list and <span Class="emphasis">curl_slist_free_all(3)</span> to clean up an entire list. </p>
<p class="level0">Each resolve rule to add should be written using the format </p><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;[+]HOST:PORT:ADDRESS[,ADDRESS]
</pre>

<p class="level0">... where HOST is the name libcurl will try to resolve, PORT is the port number of the service where libcurl wants to connect to the HOST and ADDRESS is one or more numerical IP addresses. If you specify multiple IP addresses they need to be separated by comma. If libcurl is built to support IPv6, each of the ADDRESS entries can of course be either IPv4 or IPv6 style addressing. </p>
<p class="level0">This option effectively pre-populates the DNS cache with entries for the host+port pair so redirects and everything that operations against the HOST+PORT will instead use your provided ADDRESS. </p>
<p class="level0">The optional leading &quot;+&quot; specifies that the new entry should time-out. Entries added without the leading plus character will never time-out whereas entries added with &quot;+HOST:...&quot; will time-out just like ordinary DNS cache entries. </p>
<p class="level0">If the DNS cache already has an entry for the given host+port pair, the new entry will override the former one. </p>
<p class="level0">An ADDRESS provided by this option will only be used if not restricted by the setting of <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE(3)</span> to a different IP version. </p>
<p class="level0">To remove names from the DNS cache again, to stop providing these fake resolves, include a string in the linked list that uses the format </p><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; -HOST:PORT
</pre>

<p class="level0">The entry to remove must be prefixed with a dash, and the host name and port number must exactly match what was added previously. </p><a name="DEFAULT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Default</h2>
