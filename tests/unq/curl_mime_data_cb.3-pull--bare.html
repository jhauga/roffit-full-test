<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Description</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">curl_mime_data_cb(3)</span> sets the data source of a mime part&#39;s body content from a data read callback function. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">part</span> is the part&#39;s to assign contents to. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">readfunc</span> is a pointer to a data read callback function, with a signature as shown by the above prototype. It may not be set to NULL. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">seekfunc</span> is a pointer to a seek callback function, with a signature as shown by the above prototype. This function will be used upon resending data (i.e.: after a redirect); this pointer may be set to NULL, in which case a resend is not possible. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">freefunc</span> is a pointer to a user resource freeing callback function, with a signature as shown by the above prototype. If no resource is to be freed, it may safely be set to NULL. This function will be called upon mime structure freeing. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">arg</span> is a user defined argument to callback functions. </p>
<p class="level0">The read callback function gets called by libcurl as soon as it needs to read data in order to send it to the peer - like if you ask it to upload or post data to the server. The data area pointed at by the pointer <span Class="emphasis">buffer</span> should be filled up with at most <span Class="emphasis">size</span> multiplied with <span Class="emphasis">nitems</span> number of bytes by your function. </p>
<p class="level0">Your read function must then return the actual number of bytes that it stored in that memory area. Returning 0 will signal end-of-file to the library and cause it to stop the current transfer. </p>
<p class="level0">If you stop the current transfer by returning 0 &quot;pre-maturely&quot; (i.e. before the server expected it, like when you have said you will upload N bytes and you upload less than N bytes), you may experience that the server &quot;hangs&quot; waiting for the rest of the data that will not come. </p>
<p class="level0">The read callback may return <span Class="emphasis">CURL_READFUNC_ABORT</span> to stop the current operation immediately, resulting in a <span Class="emphasis">CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK</span> error code from the transfer. </p>
<p class="level0">The callback can return <span Class="emphasis">CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE</span> to cause reading from this connection to pause. See <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_pause(3)</span> for further details. </p>
<p class="level0">The seek function gets called by libcurl to rewind input stream data or to seek to a certain position. The function shall work like fseek(3) or lseek(3) and it gets SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END as argument for <span Class="emphasis">origin</span>, although libcurl currently only passes SEEK_SET. </p>
<p class="level0">The callback function must return <span Class="emphasis">CURL_SEEKFUNC_OK</span> on success, <span Class="emphasis">CURL_SEEKFUNC_FAIL</span> to cause the upload operation to fail or <span Class="emphasis">CURL_SEEKFUNC_CANTSEEK</span> to indicate that while the seek failed, libcurl is free to work around the problem if possible. The latter can sometimes be done by instead reading from the input or similar. </p>
<p class="level0">Care must be taken if the part is bound to a curl easy handle that is later duplicated: the <span Class="emphasis">arg</span> pointer argument is also duplicated, resulting in the pointed item to be shared between the original and the copied handle. In particular, special attention should be given to the <span Class="emphasis">freefunc</span> procedure code since it will be called twice with the same argument. </p><a name="EXAMPLE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Example</h2>
<p class="level0">Sending a huge data string will cause the same amount of memory to be allocated: to avoid overhead resources consumption, one might want to use a callback source to avoid data duplication. In this case, original data must be retained until after the transfer terminates. </p><pre class="level0">
