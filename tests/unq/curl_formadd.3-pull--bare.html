<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">This function is deprecated.</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">curl_mime_init(3)</span> instead. </p>
<p class="level0">curl_formadd() is used to append sections when building a multipart form post. Append one section at a time until you have added all the sections you want included and then you pass the <span Class="emphasis">firstitem</span> pointer as parameter to <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_HTTPPOST(3)</span>.  <span Class="emphasis">lastitem</span> is set after each <span Class="emphasis">curl_formadd(3)</span> call and on repeated invokes it should be left as set to allow repeated invokes to find the end of the list faster. </p>
<p class="level0">After the <span Class="emphasis">lastitem</span> pointer follow the real arguments. </p>
<p class="level0">The pointers <span Class="emphasis">firstitem</span> and <span Class="emphasis">lastitem</span> should both be pointing to NULL in the first call to this function. All list-data will be allocated by the function itself. You must call <span Class="emphasis">curl_formfree(3)</span> on the <span Class="emphasis">firstitem</span> after the form post has been done to free the resources. </p>
<p class="level0">Using POST with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a &quot;Expect: 100-continue&quot; header. You can disable this header with <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)</span> as usual. </p>
<p class="level0">First, there are some basics you need to understand about multipart form posts. Each part consists of at least a NAME and a CONTENTS part. If the part is made for file upload, there are also a stored CONTENT-TYPE and a FILENAME. Below, we will discuss what options you use to set these properties in the parts you want to add to your post. </p>
<p class="level0">The options listed first are for making normal parts. The options from <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMFILE">CURLFORM_FILE</a> through <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMBUFFERLENGTH">CURLFORM_BUFFERLENGTH</a> are for file upload parts. </p><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Options</h2>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMCOPYNAME"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_COPYNAME</span> </p>
<p class="level1">followed by a string which provides the <span Class="emphasis">name</span> of this part. libcurl copies the string so your application does not need to keep it around after this function call. If the name is not null-terminated, you must set its length with <span Class="bold">CURLFORM_NAMELENGTH</span>. The <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is not allowed to contain zero-valued bytes. The copied data will be freed by <span Class="emphasis">curl_formfree(3)</span>. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMPTRNAME"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_PTRNAME</span> </p>
<p class="level1">followed by a string which provides the <span Class="emphasis">name</span> of this part. libcurl will use the pointer and refer to the data in your application, so you must make sure it remains until curl no longer needs it. If the name is not null-terminated, you must set its length with <span Class="bold">CURLFORM_NAMELENGTH</span>. The <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is not allowed to contain zero-valued bytes. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMCOPYCONTENTS"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS</span> </p>
<p class="level1">followed by a pointer to the contents of this part, the actual data to send away. libcurl copies the provided data, so your application does not need to keep it around after this function call. If the data is not null terminated, or if you would like it to contain zero bytes, you must set the length of the name with <a class="bold" href="#CURLFORMCONTENTSLENGTH">CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH</a>. The copied data will be freed by <span Class="emphasis">curl_formfree(3)</span>. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMPTRCONTENTS"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_PTRCONTENTS</span> </p>
<p class="level1">followed by a pointer to the contents of this part, the actual data to send away. libcurl will use the pointer and refer to the data in your application, so you must make sure it remains until curl no longer needs it.  If the data is not null-terminated, or if you would like it to contain zero bytes, you must set its length with <a class="bold" href="#CURLFORMCONTENTSLENGTH">CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH</a>. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMCONTENTLEN"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN</span> </p>
<p class="level1">followed by a curl_off_t value giving the length of the contents. Note that for <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMSTREAM">CURLFORM_STREAM</a> contents, this option is mandatory. </p>
<p class="level1">If you pass a 0 (zero) for this option, libcurl will instead do a strlen() on the contents to figure out the size. If you really want to send a zero byte content then you must make sure strlen() on the data pointer returns zero. </p>
<p class="level1">(Option added in 7.46.0) </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMCONTENTSLENGTH"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH</span> </p>
<p class="level1">(This option is deprecated. Use <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMCONTENTLEN">CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN</a> instead!) </p>
<p class="level1">followed by a long giving the length of the contents. Note that for <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMSTREAM">CURLFORM_STREAM</a> contents, this option is mandatory. </p>
<p class="level1">If you pass a 0 (zero) for this option, libcurl will instead do a strlen() on the contents to figure out the size. If you really want to send a zero byte content then you must make sure strlen() on the data pointer returns zero. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMFILECONTENT"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_FILECONTENT</span> </p>
<p class="level1">followed by a filename, causes that file to be read and its contents used as data in this part. This part does <span Class="emphasis">not</span> automatically become a file upload part simply because its data was read from a file. </p>
<p class="level1">The specified file needs to kept around until the associated transfer is done. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMFILE"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_FILE</span> </p>
<p class="level1">followed by a filename, makes this part a file upload part. It sets the <span Class="emphasis">filename</span> field to the basename of the provided filename, it reads the contents of the file and passes them as data and sets the content-type if the given file match one of the internally known file extensions. For <a class="bold" href="#CURLFORMFILE">CURLFORM_FILE</a> the user may send one or more files in one part by providing multiple <a class="bold" href="#CURLFORMFILE">CURLFORM_FILE</a> arguments each followed by the filename (and each <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMFILE">CURLFORM_FILE</a> is allowed to have a <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMCONTENTTYPE">CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE</a>). </p>
<p class="level1">The given upload file has to exist in its full in the file system already when the upload starts, as libcurl needs to read the correct file size beforehand. </p>
<p class="level1">The specified file needs to kept around until the associated transfer is done. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMCONTENTTYPE"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE</span> </p>
<p class="level1">is used in combination with <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMFILE">CURLFORM_FILE</a>. Followed by a pointer to a string which provides the content-type for this part, possibly instead of an internally chosen one. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMFILENAME"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_FILENAME</span> </p>
<p class="level1">is used in combination with <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMFILE">CURLFORM_FILE</a>. Followed by a pointer to a string, it tells libcurl to use the given string as the <span Class="emphasis">filename</span> in the file upload part instead of the actual file name. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMBUFFER"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_BUFFER</span> </p>
<p class="level1">is used for custom file upload parts without use of <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMFILE">CURLFORM_FILE</a>. It tells libcurl that the file contents are already present in a buffer. The parameter is a string which provides the <span Class="emphasis">filename</span> field in the content header. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMBUFFERPTR"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_BUFFERPTR</span> </p>
<p class="level1">is used in combination with <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMBUFFER">CURLFORM_BUFFER</a>. The parameter is a pointer to the buffer to be uploaded. This buffer must not be freed until after <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_cleanup(3)</span> is called. You must also use <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMBUFFERLENGTH">CURLFORM_BUFFERLENGTH</a> to set the number of bytes in the buffer. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMBUFFERLENGTH"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_BUFFERLENGTH</span> </p>
<p class="level1">is used in combination with <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMBUFFER">CURLFORM_BUFFER</a>. The parameter is a long which gives the length of the buffer. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMSTREAM"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_STREAM</span> </p>
<p class="level1">Tells libcurl to use the <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_READFUNCTION(3)</span> callback to get data. The parameter you pass to <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMSTREAM">CURLFORM_STREAM</a> is the pointer passed on to the read callback&#39;s fourth argument. If you want the part to look like a file upload one, set the <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMFILENAME">CURLFORM_FILENAME</a> parameter as well. Note that when using <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMSTREAM">CURLFORM_STREAM</a>, <a class="emphasis" href="#CURLFORMCONTENTSLENGTH">CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH</a> must also be set with the total expected length of the part unless the formpost is sent chunked encoded. (Option added in libcurl 7.18.2) </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMARRAY"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_ARRAY</span> </p>
<p class="level1">Another possibility to send options to curl_formadd() is the <a class="bold" href="#CURLFORMARRAY">CURLFORM_ARRAY</a> option, that passes a struct curl_forms array pointer as its value. Each curl_forms structure element has a <span Class="emphasis">CURLformoption</span> and a char pointer. The final element in the array must be a CURLFORM_END. All available options can be used in an array, except the CURLFORM_ARRAY option itself. The last argument in such an array must always be <span Class="bold">CURLFORM_END</span>. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name="CURLFORMCONTENTHEADER"></a><span class="nroffip">CURLFORM_CONTENTHEADER</span> </p>
<p class="level1">specifies extra headers for the form POST section. This takes a curl_slist prepared in the usual way using <span Class="bold">curl_slist_append</span> and appends the list of headers to those libcurl automatically generates. The list must exist while the POST occurs, if you free it before the post completes you may experience problems. </p>
<p class="level1">When you have passed the <span Class="emphasis">struct curl_httppost</span> pointer to <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_setopt(3)</span> (using the <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_HTTPPOST(3)</span> option), you must not free the list until after you have called <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_cleanup(3)</span> for the curl handle. </p>

<a name="AVAILABILITY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Availability</h2>
<p class="level0">Deprecated in 7.56.0. Before this release, field names were allowed to contain zero-valued bytes. The pseudo-filename &quot;-&quot; to read stdin is discouraged although still supported, but data is not read before being actually sent: the effective data size can then not be automatically determined, resulting in a chunked encoding transfer. Backslashes and double quotes in field and file names are now escaped before transmission. </p><a name="RETURN"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Return value</h2>
