<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Description</h2>
<p class="level0">Some protocols have &quot;connection upkeep&quot; mechanisms. These mechanisms usually send some traffic on existing connections in order to keep them alive; this can prevent connections from being closed due to overzealous firewalls, for example. </p>
<p class="level0">Currently the only protocol with a connection upkeep mechanism is HTTP/2: when the connection upkeep interval is exceeded and <span Class="emphasis">curl_easy_upkeep(3)</span> is called, an HTTP/2 PING frame is sent on the connection. </p>
<p class="level0">This function must be explicitly called in order to perform the upkeep work. The connection upkeep interval is set with <span Class="emphasis">CURLOPT_UPKEEP_INTERVAL_MS(3)</span>. </p><a name="EXAMPLE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Example</h2><pre class="level0">
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
&nbsp; /* Make a connection to an HTTP/2 server. */
