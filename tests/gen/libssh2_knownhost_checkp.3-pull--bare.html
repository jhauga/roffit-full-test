<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Description</h2>
<p class="level0">Checks a host and its associated key against the collection of known hosts, and returns info back about the (partially) matched entry. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">host</span> is a pointer the host name in plain text. The host name can be the IP numerical address of the host or the full name. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">port</span> is the port number used by the host (or a negative number to check the generic host). If the port number is given, libssh2 will check the key for the specific host + port number combination in addition to the plain host name only check. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">key</span> is a pointer to the key for the given host. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">keylen</span> is the total size in bytes of the key pointed to by the <span Class="emphasis">key</span> argument </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">typemask</span> is a bitmask that specifies format and info about the data passed to this function. Specifically, it details what format the host name is, what format the key is and what key type it is. </p>
<p class="level0">The host name is given as one of the following types: LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_TYPE_PLAIN or LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_TYPE_CUSTOM. </p>
<p class="level0">The key is encoded using one of the following encodings: LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEYENC_RAW or LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEYENC_BASE64. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">knownhost</span> if set to non-NULL, it must be a pointer to a &#39;struct libssh2_knownhost&#39; pointer that gets filled in to point to info about a known host that matches or partially matches. </p><a name="RETURN"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Return value</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">libssh2_knownhost_check(3)</span> returns info about how well the provided host + key pair matched one of the entries in the list of known hosts. </p>
<p class="level0">LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_FAILURE - something prevented the check to be made </p>
<p class="level0">LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_NOTFOUND - no host match was found </p>
<p class="level0">LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_MATCH - hosts and keys match. </p>
<p class="level0">LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_MISMATCH - host was found, but the keys did not match! </p><a name="AVAILABILITY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Availability</h2>
