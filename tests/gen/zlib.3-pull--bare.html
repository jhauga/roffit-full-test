<p class="level0">[see <span Class="emphasis">zlib.h</span> for full description] </p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Description</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">zlib</span> library is a general purpose data compression library. The code is thread safe, assuming that the standard library functions used are thread safe, such as memory allocation routines. It provides in-memory compression and decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data. This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation) but other algorithms may be added later with the same stream interface. </p>
<p class="level0">Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function. In the latter case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output (providing more output space) before each call. </p>
<p class="level0">The library also supports reading and writing files in <span Class="emphasis">gzip</span>(1) (.gz) format with an interface similar to that of stdio. </p>
<p class="level0">The library does not install any signal handler. The decoder checks the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash even in the case of corrupted input. </p>
<p class="level0">All functions of the compression library are documented in the file <span Class="emphasis">zlib.h</span>. The distribution source includes examples of use of the library in the files <span Class="emphasis">test/example.c</span> and <span Class="emphasis">test/minigzip.c,</span> as well as other examples in the <span Class="emphasis">examples/</span> directory. </p>
<p class="level0">Changes to this version are documented in the file <span Class="emphasis">ChangeLog</span> that accompanies the source. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">zlib</span> is built in to many languages and operating systems, including but not limited to Java, Python, .NET, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Swift, and Go. </p>
<p class="level0">An experimental package to read and write files in the .zip format, written on top of <span Class="emphasis">zlib</span> by Gilles Vollant (info@winimage.com), is available at: </p>
