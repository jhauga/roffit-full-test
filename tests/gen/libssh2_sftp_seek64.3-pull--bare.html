<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">handle</span> - SFTP File Handle as returned by <span Class="bold">libssh2_sftp_open_ex(3)</span> </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">offset</span> - Number of bytes from the beginning of file to seek to. </p>
<p class="level0">Move the file handle&#39;s internal pointer to an arbitrary location. libssh2 implements file pointers as a localized concept to make file access appear more POSIX like. No packets are exchanged with the server during a seek operation. The localized file pointer is used as a convenience offset during read/write operations. </p>
<p class="level0">You MUST NOT seek during writing or reading a file with SFTP, as the internals use outstanding packets and changing the &quot;file position&quot; during transit will results in badness. </p><a name="AVAILABILITY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Availability</h2>
