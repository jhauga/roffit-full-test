<p class="level0">3. Distribution Obligations. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    3.1. Application of License. &nbsp;    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are &nbsp;    governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation &nbsp;    Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be &nbsp;    distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version &nbsp;    of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a &nbsp;    copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You &nbsp;    distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code &nbsp;    version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this &nbsp;    License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include &nbsp;    an additional document offering the additional rights described in &nbsp;    Section 3.5. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    3.2. Availability of Source Code. &nbsp;    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be &nbsp;    made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License &nbsp;    either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted &nbsp;    Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an &nbsp;    Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic &nbsp;    Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) &nbsp;    months after the date it initially became available, or at least six &nbsp;    (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification &nbsp;    has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for &nbsp;    ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the &nbsp;    Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    3.3. Description of Modifications. &nbsp;    You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a &nbsp;    file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and &nbsp;    the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that &nbsp;    the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original &nbsp;    Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the &nbsp;    Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an &nbsp;    Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the &nbsp;    origin or ownership of the Covered Code. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters &nbsp;         (a) Third Party Claims. &nbsp;         If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s &nbsp;         intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights &nbsp;         granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, &nbsp;         Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code &nbsp;         distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the &nbsp;         party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will &nbsp;         know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after &nbsp;         the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, &nbsp;         Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies &nbsp;         Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps &nbsp;         (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) &nbsp;         reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered &nbsp;         Code that new knowledge has been obtained. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;         (b) Contributor APIs. &nbsp;         If Contributor&#39;s Modifications include an application programming &nbsp;         interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which &nbsp;         are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must &nbsp;         also include this information in the LEGAL file. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;              (c)    Representations. &nbsp;         Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to &nbsp;         Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s &nbsp;         Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or &nbsp;         Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by &nbsp;         this License. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    3.5. Required Notices. &nbsp;    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source &nbsp;    Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source &nbsp;    Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a &nbsp;    location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely &nbsp;    to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) &nbsp;    You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in &nbsp;    Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation &nbsp;    for the Source Code where You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership &nbsp;    rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to &nbsp;    charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability &nbsp;    obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You &nbsp;    may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial &nbsp;    Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than &nbsp;    any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is &nbsp;    offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial &nbsp;    Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the &nbsp;    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, &nbsp;    support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. &nbsp;    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the &nbsp;    requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, &nbsp;    and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of &nbsp;    the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, &nbsp;    including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the &nbsp;    obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included &nbsp;    in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or &nbsp;    collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the &nbsp;    Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered &nbsp;    Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may &nbsp;    contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in &nbsp;    compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the &nbsp;    Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s &nbsp;    rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this &nbsp;    License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different &nbsp;    license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ &nbsp;    from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial &nbsp;    Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the &nbsp;    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by &nbsp;    the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such &nbsp;    terms You offer. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    3.7. Larger Works. &nbsp;    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code &nbsp;    not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger &nbsp;    Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the &nbsp;    requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. </p>
<p class="level0">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this &nbsp;    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to &nbsp;    statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with &nbsp;    the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) &nbsp;    describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description &nbsp;    must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must &nbsp;    be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the &nbsp;    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be &nbsp;    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to &nbsp;    understand it. </p>
<p class="level0">5. Application of this License. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has &nbsp;    attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. </p>
<p class="level0">6. Versions of the License. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    6.1. New Versions. &nbsp;    Netscape Communications Corporation (&quot;Netscape&quot;) may publish revised &nbsp;    and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version &nbsp;    will be given a distinguishing version number. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    6.2. Effect of New Versions. &nbsp;    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the &nbsp;    License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that &nbsp;    version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms &nbsp;    of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one &nbsp;    other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to &nbsp;    Covered Code created under this License. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    6.3. Derivative Works. &nbsp;    If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may &nbsp;    only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code &nbsp;    governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that &nbsp;    the phrases &quot;Mozilla&quot;, &quot;MOZILLAPL&quot;, &quot;MOZPL&quot;, &quot;Netscape&quot;, &nbsp;    &quot;MPL&quot;, &quot;NPL&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your &nbsp;    license (except to note that your license differs from this License) &nbsp;    and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license &nbsp;    contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and &nbsp;    Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial &nbsp;    Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in &nbsp;    Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of &nbsp;    this License.) </p>
<p class="level0">7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, &nbsp;    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, &nbsp;    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF &nbsp;    DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. &nbsp;    THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE &nbsp;    IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, &nbsp;    YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE &nbsp;    COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER &nbsp;    OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF &nbsp;    ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. </p>
<p class="level0">8. TERMINATION. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate &nbsp;    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure &nbsp;    such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All &nbsp;    sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall &nbsp;    survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their &nbsp;    nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License &nbsp;    shall survive. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement &nbsp;    claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer &nbsp;    or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom &nbsp;    You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;)  alleging that: </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    (a)  such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly &nbsp;    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such &nbsp;    Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License &nbsp;    shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, &nbsp;    unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) &nbsp;    agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable &nbsp;    royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such &nbsp;    Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to &nbsp;    the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days &nbsp;    of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not &nbsp;    mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim &nbsp;    is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under &nbsp;    Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of &nbsp;    the 60 day notice period specified above. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s &nbsp;    Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then &nbsp;    any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) &nbsp;    and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, &nbsp;    sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that &nbsp;    Participant. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant &nbsp;    alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or &nbsp;    indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as &nbsp;    by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent &nbsp;    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses &nbsp;    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken &nbsp;    into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or &nbsp;    license. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, &nbsp;    all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) &nbsp;    which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder &nbsp;    prior to termination shall survive termination. </p>
<p class="level0">9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT &nbsp;    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL &nbsp;    DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, &nbsp;    OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR &nbsp;    ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY &nbsp;    CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, &nbsp;    WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER &nbsp;    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN &nbsp;    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF &nbsp;    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY &nbsp;    RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW &nbsp;    PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE &nbsp;    EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO &nbsp;    THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. </p>
<p class="level0">10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. </p>

<p class="level0">&nbsp;    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject &nbsp;    matter hereof.

<p class="level0">12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is &nbsp;    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, &nbsp;    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to &nbsp;    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such &nbsp;    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or &nbsp;    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. </p>
<p class="level0">13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. </p>
<p class="level0">&nbsp;    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as &nbsp;    &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot;.  &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot; means that the Initial &nbsp;    Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under &nbsp;    Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified &nbsp;    by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A. </p>
